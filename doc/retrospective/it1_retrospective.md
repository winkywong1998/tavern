In iteration 1, we modified our requirement specifications, designed UML class diagram and had a start-up on our project.
For the requirement specifications, we modified the functional requirements to meet the role-goal-benefit format. Also, as we decided to add company entity, 
related requirements are added to our SRS. According to the feedback on iteration 0 from the professor, we should present the unique matching system more clearly 
in SRS. So we modified the Proposed Solution part to describe it in detail.
Besides, we designed the initial version of our UML class diagram. We included all the objects and relationships we have planned so far in our class diagram 1.
Furthermore, we set up the basic structure of frontend and backend for the beginning of our project. Then, we finished basic CRUD functions of Post entity according to 
the user stories in SRS. And the database schema for Post entity is created in our Mysql database, Tavern.

The tasks we planned for iteration 1 are all completed in time and well done. But there are still a few improvements we can perform in iteration 2.
Firstly, as we have determined our technology stack, we need to modify the Software Architecture & Technology Stack part in SRS.
Also, the first UML class diagram needs to be rearranged to be tidy and clear. As we may redesign some entities and project structure in iteration 2, class diagram 
needs further modification.
In iteration 1, we just finished a few simple functions so that it was easy to connect frontend to backend and database. However, in iteration 2, we plan to finish 
functions of User entity and Company entity. The functions are more complicated and may need modification in Post entity as well. We must pay attention to details 
and make requirements clear for both frontend and backend.

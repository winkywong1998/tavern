In iteration2, we modified our requirement specifications, redesigned UML class diagram, modified some project files and structures and progressed a lot in both frontend and backend work. \
To make requirement specifications more accurate and instructional, we modified our target clients and dove deeper into the software frameworks 
that we are building this app with. We searched for related materials and had discussions. In our new UML class diagram, we removed several useless 
classes and modified relationships between classes to enhance our design. \
For frontend, we have incorporated layout template to embellish user interface. We also designed and implemented functions of post, company, matching and login pages. 
In addition to frontend work, we finished basic functionality of our post board and company list in backend and database. 
We did modifications to existing entities in order to make them more compatible to future development. Another significant progress in backend is the realization 
of basic functionalities of the User entity including Participant and Admin. In this way, we finished the prototype of Team entity and managed to support two people matching 
with a simple KMeans algorithm. 

For iteration 3, we will realize the function that passes current user as a parameter to other pages and add authorization for actions like managing companies and posts and so on. 
The new Meeting entity will be created, and its related CRUD functionalities will be developed.
Besides, we are going to support matching pool system, so that people that are matched and not matched can be separated. We may also support multiple people matching with the system. 
Furthermore, some improvements will be made to company list and post board modules.
We are going to design different user interfaces for participant and admin and design the meeting page. We are going to support UI with different type of user including admin, participant and unlogin as well.
